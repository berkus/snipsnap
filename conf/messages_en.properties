  your country to make sure you see the right messages.
config.app.language            = Language
config.app.language.text       = \
  Select your language. SnipSnap uses this setting to provide localized \

  The mail server is necessary for delivering email. It is used to send \
  password reset mails to users of your site. Do not simply enter any host. \
  Ask your local network administrator what the host name of your mail server \
  is (usually mail or mailhost). You need to be able to send email via this \
  host without authentication.
config.app.mail.domain         = Email Domain
config.app.mail.domain.text    = \
  Enter the domain part for Email sent by this site. This is usally the part \

  Protect the Email-to-Weblog post function with a password. The password must \
  appear in the email sent to SnipSnap in order to post to the weblog. Keep in \

  password similar to your workstation or banking passwords.
config.app.mail.pop3.host      = POP3 Host
config.app.mail.pop3.host.text = \
  Enter the host name of your POP3 server.
config.app.mail.pop3.user      = POP3 User

  This is the user whose Email is posted to the weblog. DO NOT use your normal \
  email account! Create a new Email account for the sole purpose of posting to \
  your weblog.
config.app.mail.pop3.password  = POP3 Password
config.app.mail.pop3.password.text = \
  Provide the password to retrieve email via POP3.
config.app.mail.pop3.interval  = POP3 Polling Interval
config.app.mail.pop3.interval.text = \
  SnipSnap will regularly ask the POP3 server if there are new messages. How \
  often this is done is determined by this setting. Enter the amount in \
  minutes between polls.

# Proxy Server Settings
config.step.proxy              = Proxy Settings
config.guide.proxy             = \

config.detected                = detected
config.app.real.autodetect.text = \
  SnipSnap can automatically detect the host and port of the Apache Proxy \
  server. Disable only if you know exactly that you will only use the host \
  and port set below. Setting the proxy host and port will lock SnipSnap to \
  the settings below.
config.app.real.host           = Real Host
config.app.real.host.text      = \
  This host address as a fully qualified domain name for the proxy host.
config.app.real.port           = Real Port
config.app.real.port.text      = \
  If you are using a port number other than 80 on the proxy server, enter it \
  here. Port 80 is the default HTTP port.
config.app.real.path           = Real Context Path
config.app.real.path.text      = \
  The context path is anything that comes after the host and port in the URL \
  and just before /space/start of SnipSnap. If you use a context path other \
  than '/' on your proxy server you must always set it here.

config.guide.expert            = \
  These settings may heavily change the way SnipSnap works and should be \
  changed with care. <b>Changing some of these values may make SnipSnap \
  unusable!</b>
config.app.start.snip          = Start Snip
config.app.start.snip.text     = \
  Normally 'start' is the home page of the SnipSnap site. You can redirect \
  to any other existing Snip by entering its name here.


config.app.perm.createSnip     = Auto-Create
config.app.perm.createSnip.text = \
  Automatically go to the edit page whenever a non-existent Snip is \
  requested. This setting is required for embedding SnipSnap into other \
  applications that have no means of detecting a missing Snip. It is used \
  in SnipSnaps Eclipse IDE integration.
config.app.index.path          = Index Path
config.app.index.path.text     = \
  Path on your local file system where the indices of the full-text search \
  engine are stored. SnipSnap will try to create this path if it does not \
  exist and you may need to move existing files to the new path if changed.
config.app.file.path           = File Path
config.app.file.path.text      = \
  Path on your local file system where attachments are stored. SnipSnap will \
  try to create this path if it does not exist and you may need to move \

  and file names in the character encoding of your server, so be careful.
config.app.logger              = Logging
config.app.logger.text         = \
  For debugging purposes logging of SnipSnap actions may be enabled. Loggins \
  slows down the server and should not be enabled in production sites unless \
  there is an error to be found.
config.logger.none             = No Logging
config.logger.system.err       = Log to System Error
config.logger.system.out       = Log to System Standard Out
config.logger.application      = Display Log in Webpage
config.app.cache               = Caching Strategy
config.app.cache.text          = \
  The caching strategy determines how Snips and other database content is \
  handled. For small sites the full caching is recommended where all content \
  is held in memory. Large sites with thousands of Snips may consider using \
  a less memory consuming strategy.
config.caching.full            = Full In-Memory Caching
config.caching.cache           = Least Used Caching
config.app.encoding            = Encoding
